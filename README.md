This is a project I did for an assignment in the class CS110.

The assignment required me to create a program that allows the user to create a list of 9 companies.
The program needs to be able to:
	1. Add a record./n
	2. Search for a record.
	3. Sort the list of companies alphabetically.
	4. Delete a record.
	5. Update a record.
	6. Save the list to a file.
	7. Read the list from a file (the file name must be "company_list.txt").
	8. Display the list in the terminal.
